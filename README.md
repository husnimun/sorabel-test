## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`
Installs `node_modules`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
Currently, the project has tests for `src/helpers` and `src/store` folders only. You can see the coverage report [here](https://codecov.io/gh/husnimun/sorabel-test).

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
